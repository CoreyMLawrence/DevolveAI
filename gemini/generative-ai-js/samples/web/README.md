# Google Generative AI Sample for Web (Javascript)

This sample app demonstrates how to use state-of-the-art
generative AI models (like Gemini) to build AI-powered features and applications.

To try out this sample app, you'll need a modern web browser and a local http server.

## Requirements

Follow the instructions on Google AI Studio [setup page](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) to obtain an API key.

Itâ€™s strongly recommended that you do not check an API key into your version control system. Instead, you should use a secrets store for your API key.

The Node.js http server provided alonside this app (`http-server.js`) assumes that you're providing an `API_KEY` environment variable.

## Features

This sample showcases the following API capablilites:

- `index.html` - demonstrates the Text and MultiModal feature from the SDK
- `chat.html` - demonstrates the Multi-turn Conversations feature from the SDK
