# DevolveAI
DevolveAI is a web-based AI-driven decompiler designed to transform executable files into their original source code. With its sleek user interface and intuitive functionality, DevolveAI empowers users to effortlessly reverse engineer executables and access their underlying source code. Moreover, once the source code is extracted, DevolveAI offers seamless translation into various programming languages and further customization through AI-driven enhancements.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Decompilation:** Utilizes cutting-edge AI algorithms to decompile executables into human-readable source code.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with a gorgeous and intuitive user interface for effortless navigation and interaction.
- **Language Translation:** Allows users to translate extracted source code into multiple programming languages.
- **Customization with AI:** Enables further customization and enhancement of source code using AI-driven tools.
